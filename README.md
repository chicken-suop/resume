# Commit message definition

I use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for project and because resume is very hard to apply the prefix definition 
(What meaning of `feature` in resume ? One more Experience? Changed the theme ? )

Let redefine the `feat` definition here 

* feat - change related to resume content

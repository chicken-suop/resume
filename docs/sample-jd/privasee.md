# Full Stack Engineer

Based or contracting from the United Kingdom | Full-Time

Competitive salary based on your skills and experience (£45,000 - £70,000)

200,000 tech startups in the EU are currently processing billions of data points daily. This could include sensitive information like your bank account, your interests or your sexual preference. The GDPR was an EU law that aimed to protect this data from being exploited.

Although the regulation is a good thing, it’s created a problem for hundreds of thousands of companies. Forcing them to spend (absurd amounts of) money on one-off consultants. Every time the regulation changes, they have to pay again or take the risk on the chin.

Privasee is the world’s first platform helping companies become and remain compliant without the need for consultants. Our platform uses language models to understand the ins and outs of a company, provide recommendations, generate policies, and monitor any regulatory changes all over the world.

Having just raised our second round of VC backing and secured a Government grant, we are expanding our team to rapidly scale and expand the business. Therefore we are seeking an experienced hands-on over-achiever who thinks outside of the box, is not afraid to take ownership, will deliver unique ideas and likes to work in a fast-paced environment.

As a Senior Full Stack Developer, you will help us expand our current product by working collaboratively and interactively, delivering a pixel-perfect cloud-based application. You will closely work together with our CTO and will have significant decision-making power on the technologies and architecture that we use to build out the platform.

_The bottom line is that the things we build help make the world a better, more transparent place, and we would love for you to join us and help!_

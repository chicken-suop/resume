## Tell me about the role.

We thought you would never ask! The Full-Stack Engineer is part of our Product Engineering team and is responsible for developing and maintaining both front-end and back-end components of our web applications. You will collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet our customers' needs.

## A day in the life of a Full Stack Engineer.

As a Full Stack Engineer at Zensai, your day begins with a brief catch-up session with the development team, where you discuss the progress on current tasks and upcoming work in Azure DevOps. Here, you also address any blockers that may arise, emphasizing collaboration as the key to ensuring smooth progress.

Next, you dive into your tasks from the agile board. This could involve writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code, participating in pull request and code reviews, and contributing to product backlog refinement sessions as needed. Your input helps shape the direction of the project and ensures alignment with team goals. Additionally, you collaborate with cross-functional teams to design, develop, and maintain robust web applications using React and Python.

Throughout the day, you engage in Teams calls with fellow team members to collaborate on shared tasks or debug any issues that arise. Clear communication and teamwork are essential in resolving challenges and moving projects forward.

You also play a crucial role in monitoring the continuous integration pipeline, ensuring that any blockers are promptly addressed to maintain the efficiency of the development process. You work closely with UI/UX designers to implement visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, integrating user-facing elements with server-side logic to ensure seamless user experiences. Additionally, you develop and maintain database schemas, queries, and optimization strategies for PostgreSQL using Django Migrations.

Conducting thorough testing of applications to identify and resolve bugs, performance issues, and other technical problems is also part of your responsibilities.

# Full Stack Product Engineer

We're looking for full stack engineers to build beautiful&functional products from start-to-finish. We’re flexible about when you work and believe in experimentation – whether that’s with how we build things or how our teams work. We’d love to chat to you if you like the sound of this and love to build great user experiences!

We are a "remote-first" company and there's no requirement for anyone to come into the zeroheight office on a regular basis - more details on what remote-first looks like

## What would you be doing? 👩‍💻

We're still small (14 product engineers, 60 people total) so you'd be working on building all types of features teaming up with a designer and product manager. You'll have start-to-finish ownership of the features – this brings accountability but also an awesome sense of pride when users love your work. You'll be involved in planning scope to ensure we deliver value to our users quickly.

Here are some examples of recent features to give a taste of what you could be working on:

- new ways of storing, managing and exporting design tokens, aligned to the W3C spec
- integrating zeroheight with communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams
- adding theming capabilities to our platform so users can better document things like dark and light modes

You'll also be included in some things that are outside the traditional "software engineering" domain. Things like helping with support queries, planning the product roadmap, project management for your features and contributing to wider company processes. There’ll also be plenty of opportunities to share your work, new technologies you’ve been exploring and things you’ve learnt with the team. Joining now is great if you want to broaden your skills or you'd like to create your own startup at some point.

If you're interested, here's a more detailed idea of what you'd be up to in the first 6 months

## How is zeroheight different? ❄️

Here's what we think zeroheight does differently compared to another job you might be considering:

- a focus on QA and UX – we take UX quality seriously and make sure everything is excellent before we ship. This also means we have to be careful about scope-creep to ensure we have time to polish.
- ownership – you'll own a feature from start-to-finish. This means you have the freedom to choose how to build it and you're responsible for the implementation and release.
- everyone plans – we try to get everyone involved in planning and scoping features to prevent a top-down approach where engineers are just pumping out feature specs.
- document all the things – we use Notion for our process documentation and try to keep communication on Slack as open as possible.
- 10% time – we set aside a day every 2 weeks to work on whatever you like.

## Our tech stack 📚

We use React to build any new UI components, paired with Storybook to work on them in isolation. We then integrate them into the main product. Some of our older codebase is written in Marionette (Backbone.js) and we're working on a smooth transition (instead of a massive rewrite).

On the backend, our main server is in Rails (Ruby). We host our database and cloud infrastructure on AWS and use serverless functions (AWS Lambda) for a few things.

One word of warning – if you're super passionate about a particular tech, our startup might not be the right place for you. We're focused on getting things done and shipping an amazing product; we'll use whatever tech helps us get there.

## Are we a good match? 💚

If these points mostly resonate, let's have a chat:

- You love creating beautiful UIs with precision and attention to detail; you understand how important design is to a successful product
- You're curious to learn about the design process and design systems.
- You relish the excitement of a startup – you have a proactive attitude and a strong desire to succeed in an environment where you'll need to be efficient and adaptable to change.
- You're looking for somewhere to grow – you want to get stuck in and have a real impact in the company's future. You're flexible and not afraid of taking on more responsibility as we grow.

## What we're looking for 🌱

### Required experience

- 3 years or more working as a software engineer
- Experience with JavaScript and React
- Some experience with backend

### Useful / Bonus experience

- Ruby
- AWS / Servers

## How do we work? ⚗️

Each of our teams has autonomy to work in a way that is best for them, experimenting with their processes freely. In general, teams tend not to have traditional standups and instead share plans and updates over Slack – we really value flexibility and this kind of thing allows people to read the updates in their own time. Hours are flexible – we have a recommended weekly total and times we try to keep our meetings between, but we’re keen you can fit your work around things you might need to do at home.

We have regular retrospectives to take a look at how we can improve our processes – both at a team level and across Engineering. Teams also do sprint planning either weekly or fortnightly to schedule work, and we tend to rotate responsibility for facilitating these around the team.

The feature roadmap is planned quarterly by the whole team. We base it on a consolidation of the feedback from our users and our strategic plans.

## Company values

### Let's look after each other - Burnout is not an acceptable part of the job

Many of us at zeroheight, including our CEO, have had our own struggles with mental health. As a company, it's something we understand. So we want to make sure that we're supporting people as much as possible with it. We know the impact that mental health can have on quality of life and we believe it should be treated the same as physical health. The reason it isn't is purely because of stigma, and we think that's BS! Think about this – in the 60s, going for a run wasn't seen as healthy, it was treated as a crime in some places in the US... So we believe (and hope!) that the mental health stigma will evolve too as people become more open about it and aware of it. We want zeroheight to be part of that change and having mental health as a core value is a step in that direction.

### Let's be humble - We value great people who are humble over exceptional people with big egos

Big egos aren't good team players. Big egos can be condescending / rude and put other people down. Big egos focus on how to make themselves look better, not what's in the best interest of the team. Big egos don't connect deeply with other people as it requires them to be vulnerable. Acknowledging mistakes is important to learn and grow and push the team forward, but big egos avoid or hide mistakes as it makes them look bad. Big egos get in the way of productive, healthy discussions. Basically, big egos slow companies down and make work less fun, so they're not welcome at zeroheight. Let's be humble instead :)

### Let's be humans - We value connecting with each other as human beings not just as colleagues

We spend a lot of our lives at work so we think work should be enjoyable. And we believe that one of the best ways to make work enjoyable is by connecting with each other on a human level. We are not our roles! We value getting to know and forming relationships with the real humans that work at zeroheight, not work personas. This also puts a strong onus on us as a company to create a diverse and inclusive environment where people can and want to bring their true selves to work.

### Let's be owners - We value empowering people over trying to prevent mistakes

- Mistakes are valuable. Making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn and grow. But you can't make mistakes if you don't take the training wheels off aka if you have someone micro-managing you. You have to have the freedom to make them in the first place and that requires you to have ownership and autonomy.
- Ownership also leads to better collaboration as it increases clarity – ownership makes it easier for people to understand what people expect of them and increases accountability
- Last but not least, ownership leads to people pushing themselves further than they thought they could go. It gives people the ability to make an impact, and impact gives people purpose and meaning – the stuff that makes it exciting to get out of bed in the morning 🛌🤸🏼‍♂️

### Let's build a product users love so much they tell their friends

As dramatic as it sounds, without this value, _zeroheight probably would not exist_. It was Jerome and Robin's focus on creating a product with a great user experience that led to zeroheight's survival in the early years. The simple and user-friendly UX meant that users could easily pick zeroheight up and convince their boss to buy it, which led to much needed revenue growth at a time when zeroheight realllly needed it... (☠️)
This user appreciation for zeroheight is also what has enabled the company to scale past 1000s of customers purely through word-of-mouth and land some of the world's biggest and most exciting companies as clients. Building a great product that product teams love and that empowers them is simply also what excites and motivates us! There is something incredibly rewarding about delighting product people (arguably the pickiest users of all ;)) with our own product and design choices. Let's keep it up forever and continue to raise the bar! Our ambition is for zeroheight to be one of the world's most admired companies when it comes to UX.

### Let's push each other We value personal growth over avoiding difficult conversations

Pushing each other is not something we do to each other, it’s something we do for each other. We owe it to one another to help each other grow and meet our potential. Prioritizing either comfort or pushing yourself over one another creates an imbalance, while creating an intersection of these goals is the most satisfying work environment. Being willing to put ourselves out there and have tough conversations is one of the kindest things we can do for each other.

This value is compatible with the others when practiced intentionally. Without our other values, these conversations could be construed negatively (overwork, burnout). Looking after each other allows us to know that we care about each other. The human element helps us build trust in one another. Valuing ownership ensures we have a growth mindset. These complementary values become conducive to an environment where people can push each other in a safe way.

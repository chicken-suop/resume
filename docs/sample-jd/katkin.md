# Mid-level Full-Stack Engineer

## KatKin's Opportunity

Did you know that some cat food contains as little as 4% meat? Cats are carnivores – they need meat to thrive – but cat food companies use powdered animal derivatives because it’s cheaper and easier, and they top it up with grains and fillers that cats find hard to digest. It’s all about shelf life and profit; not what cats really need.

We do things differently at KatKin. We’re changing the cat food industry, with our 100% Fresh-cooked premium meat recipes, delivered to doorsteps everywhere. Each recipe is designed by our in-house vets and nutritionists, to be the very best (and tastiest) nutrition for cats.

KatKin is building a global challenger brand in cat health and wellbeing, going after a $50B global market. Beyond the core product of Fresh food for cats, KatKin’s vision is to build a set of products and services for Cat Parents to manage their cat’s health. Everything from litter and treats, to digital health management for your cat.

Today, KatKin is a UK D2C business that recently expanded into Retail and is planning to launch international markets, likely the US, from 2025 onwards.

## The Role

Millions of cat parents engage with KatKin every month, and as a Full-Stack Engineer at KatKin, you’ll work alongside our Engineering team in bringing our hardcore cat parent’s digital journey to life.

You will work closely with our Director of Engineering, Product, Design, Data, and the rest of the Engineering team to help meet the day-to-day and long-term ambitions of KatKin and its customers. You will own and create the components and technology necessary to provide a best-in-class experience for cat parents whenever they visit our website or use our subscription service.

We are a close-knit, focused team who are committed to consistently delivering high quality technology, on time, as part of a tech-driven mindset that lets us focus on building the right solutions for scaling our business into the future.

Our current tech stack makes heavy use of TypeScript, particularly NextJS on the frontend, NestJS microservices on the backend with Prisma, and various other technologies and tools like Postgresql and RabbitMQ.

This role will work from our London office in Farringdon 3 days a week.

# Intermediate Software Engineer (TypeScript)

## Description

🔔 Please note before applying: this is an Intermediate II level role within our team, and so we are really keen to see Product Engineers with solid commercial experience working with TypeScript & React. If this is you then we would love to hear from you!

📍 Location: London (E1)

🖥 Hybrid working as standard: 2 days a week in the office, the other 3 days remote (or office if you prefer)

## Our mission:

- Two in five people in the UK rent their homes. Goodlord's mission? To provide them with the best renting experience in the world 🌎
- We started Goodlord because we wanted to make renting simple and transparent for everyone involved: the agent, the landlord, and the tenant. We knew Generation Rent would lead to more tenants, with higher digital expectations and we were confident we could provide a solution 🏠
- Like all scale-ups it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster journey, but we’re now stronger than ever, with around 3,000 letting agents using the platform, exciting and varied products and 350+ Goodlordians across the group supporting the mission! 💚

## The Opportunity:

- Work with product managers, designers, business colleagues and other engineers to understand end user problems and implement appropriate solutions
- Assist your squad by delivering features and with them
- Use your knowledge on React and Typescript to continuously identify areas of improvement and propose fixes
- Review the code of your colleagues
- Offer mentoring to less experienced developers

## What we need from you:

- Significant commercial experience building web based applications using Typescript (and ideally React.)
- An excellent understanding of state management and creating components and pages that are reusable and testable, and an understanding of architectural patterns like DDD and microservices.
- Proficient at writing automated tests using frameworks such as Jest, React Testing Library or Cypress.
- Strong knowledge of web application security and how to guard against common vulnerabilities.

## What's in it for you:

- 🚀 Grow with Goodlord: your development is important to us, that’s why we are . Have a goal in mind? Share it with us and you can use your £1000 annual development fund to support it. We guarantee you’ll learn loads and develop both personally and professionally at Goodlord too!
- 💕 Your well-being matters: bi-weekly coaching with Sanctus to provide Goodlordians with a safe place to talk and support your mental health
- 🌴 25 days holiday (plus UK Bank holidays) plus 1 day per full holiday year up to 32 days: We believe regular breaks are essential for well-being and we encourage (some may say expect!) all Goodlordians to take full advantage of their annual leave entitlement.
- 🤗 Supporting your family: we offer Goodlordians of all genders a generous 3 months of fully-paid time off to look after their new arrivals

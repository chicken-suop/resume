# Front End Engineer (TypeScript)

Location - Sheffield base office
Hybrid working as standard, 2 days a week in the office, the other 3 days from home/office

## About the team that drives our platform

We're a PropTech scale-up who have created a revolutionary, cloud-based software platform to bring together agents, landlords and tenants online and process all the paperwork electronically.
Our small, self-organising squads build the platforms and tools to help us achieve our mission. We're disrupting an industry, so there's plenty of thorny, real-world problems to solve on behalf of the agents, landlords and tenants that use our system.
If you want to develop new skills, there'll be plenty of opportunities: many of our current team joined as back-end or front-end developers, and are now working across the full stack.
We are keen advocates of agile delivery; we work closely with our stakeholders and use Kanban to iterate quickly on customer feedback. You'll be learning every day, from the team around you and senior members of the team who you'll have daily exposure to.

## The Tech we use

Our platform is built with multiple PHP 8 applications running on Symfony (5.4/6), all deployed within Docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS. Data is persisted in a MYSQL (AWS Aurora) database. Additionally, we leverage AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway for running supplementary services.
Our UI is a mixture of jQuery and React (using Typescript) and weâ€™re actively pushing to have everything in React.
We use Github for version control and Github Actions for building, testing and deploying code to the staging and production environments.

## **About Neutreeno**

Imagine a future where companies can slash emissions not just by a little, but significantly across vast and complex supply chains. Neutreeno, a pioneering deep tech spinout from the University of Cambridge’s Engineering Department, is turning this vision into a reality.

Our revolutionary digital platform precisely tracks process flows, equipping businesses with scientific, data-driven insights needed to optimise emission reduction interventions across thousands of suppliers. Forget offsets - it's about real emissions reductions at source.

Neutreeno is not just about cutting-edge tech; it’s about pioneering a new low-carbon era with a brain trust of leading sustainability scientists from the IPCC, IEA, the Cambridge Engineering Department and other renowned Universities. Together, our research underpins a transformative technology already adopted by some of the world’s largest companies.

Our impact is resonating globally. We just raised a US-led $5m seed round from leading global investors in circularity, sustainability, and corporates as featured in [ESGPost](https://esgpost.com/cambridge-scientists-secure-5m-funding-to-drive-global-decarbonisation/), [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cambridge-scientists-secure-5m-leading-130300577.html), [BusinessWeekly](https://www.businessweekly.co.uk/posts/neutreeno-poised-to-clean-up-in-130-trillion-decarbonisation-market).

# Airlinen, Full Stack Developer

## There are plenty of reasons to apply for a job. Here are some reasons that you should apply for this one

- You are motivated and entrepreneurial
- You want to be responsible for things and take the initiative
- You enjoy learning things and solving different problems every day

## Here are some reasons why you should not

- You want an easy life
- You want a premade ‘career path’
- You need to be told what to do

## Who we are

We are a company that supplies services and products to the hospitality sector, but what we really are is a logistics company.
We handle hundreds of orders a day and are constantly growing, which means we need a tech team who can keep up with the company’s roadmap.

We have built our business from zero without outside funding and, as such, we value—most of all—people who appreciate what it takes to run a real business in the real world.

We are building an event-driven platform that will help bring automation and faster information flow to our industry. This is a space that is ready for change, and we are looking to be the leaders in this market on the technology front.

We are already the leaders on the offline front, and now is the time to capitalize on this. Instead of building an army, however, we want to build a small but powerful team with autonomy, much like a Seal Team Six. This is not a VC-funded role nor one loaded with unnecessary bullshit.

## The Role

The role itself requires some coding competence, but if you know your way around the stack, then the specifics are less important. Here is the stack:

- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- React (NextJS) and Tailwind CSS
  Initially, we need someone who can jump in and help on the front-end side. However, there is plenty of work to have a go at in the back-end and infrastructure as well. This is essentially a startup inside an existing business, so you will have a say in things like the design, architecture, and build decisions. There isn’t much by way of documentation, and we will need to figure out how best to get this sorted, but if you don’t mind a challenge, this will be no issue for you.

Naturally, as someone who comes in on the ground floor, we would be willing to give you a chance to have some ownership of what you build. This means share options as well as the ability to shape the future direction of what we build.

## Nice to haves

- AI interest and any experience always welcomed
- B2B business experience
- Good jokes and quick wit

## Other Details

The role is hybrid with a preference to being London based, as we feel at least initially there is a need to solve problems on the whiteboard and have natural interaction in the office. You will also be speaking directly to our clients and be involved in meetings that have impacts throughout the business. There will also be a potential for some international travel as part of the job.

One thing to bear in mind is that this is not rocket science, and our preferred approach is to try, test, fail, and improve. If you are a perfectionist or someone who gets anxious at the thought of uncertainty, this role is not for you.

There is no minimum or maximum level of required experience aside from some coding ability. All that matters is your willingness to get stuck in and learn. If you are a senior that is sick and tired of doing the same old boring stuff or you’ve reached a dead end, come and have a chat. If you are a bootcamp graduate and want to dive headfirst into the deep end, please come and say hello.

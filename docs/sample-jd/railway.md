# Senior Full-Stack Engineer - Product

## Job description

Our core mission at Railway is to make software engineers higher leverage. We believe that people should be given powerful tools so that they can spend less time setting up to do, and more time doing.

At Railway, we believe that making tooling more accessible for build and deployment is one of the greatest possible productivity unlocks of our generation. We also believe that the major roadblock between us and our goal is strong interfacing paradigms.

If you’re looking to build an operating system for builders, we’d love to talk with you!

> “Computer scientists have so far worked on developing powerful programming languages that make it possible to solve the technical problems of computation. Little effort has gone toward devising the language of interaction.”

## About the role

For this role, you will:

- Build features end-to-end, from the UI in our dashboard to orchestrating workflows that interact with our microservices using Temporal.
- Craft intuitive interfaces that allow our users to interface with powerful computing paradigms, with help from our design team.
- Build TypeScript + GraphQL APIs with strong guarantees around modeling data, allowing both internal and external users to build against.
- Write Engineering Requirement Documents to take something from idea, to defined tasks, to implementation, to monitoring its success.
- Experience with, or at least the desire to learn Rust to contribute to our open-source repositories (CLI, Nixpacks, etc)
- You may be oncall from time to time in this role.

### Some projects full-stack engineers have worked on in the past:

- Rebuild logging infrastructure to support 1B logs/day, from configuring ClickHouse to developing a brand new observability UI.
- Build Git for infrastructure and re-thinking how a project evolves over time.
- Build a tool for building user code into a deployable image using Nix packages. [github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks](https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks).
- Create interfaces to visualize project infrastructure on a 2D canvas.
- Add support for migrating deployments with a volume from one region to another using Temporal.
- Create a marketplace for users to share re-usable pieces of infrastructure.

This is a high impact, high agency role with direct effect on company culture, trajectory, and outcome.

## About you

You should possess:

- An ability to autonomously lead, design, and implement great product experiences, from front to back.
- A strong understanding of frontend architecture to build interactivity-rich systems for fetching, mutating, and rendering data effectively.
- Experience managing complex asynchronous backend jobs for something like a build/deploy pipeline.
- A desire to be a part of the entire project development process. From research gathering and planning, to implementation and monitoring.
- Great written and verbal communication skills for expressing ideas, designs, and potential solutions in mostly-asynchronous manner.
- We value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds.

## Our Values

What keeps our engines running:

- **Autonomy:** We trust each other to get the job done knowing that we are all working towards the same goal.
- **Stewardship:** We're dedicated to making software that leaves a satisfying experience. We take it personally.
- **Growth:** We're not afraid to get our hands dirty and learn new skills in order to rise to the task at hand.
- **Harmony:** We give people the consideration & space to voice their needs, and listen eagerly when hearing them.

## Things to know

- For better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.
- We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.
- We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.
- We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.
- We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.

## Benefits and perks

At Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page.

Beyond compensation, here are a few things that make working at Railway truly unique:

- **Autonomy:** We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work or outside of work.
- **Ownership:** We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.
- **Novel problems/solutions:** We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and believe, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc., there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.
- **Growth:** We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.

## How we hire

No tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:

1. **Talk with us about the role:** This is completely open-ended; we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.
2. **Work on a small project to discuss in the interview:** Asynchronously implement the following:
   - Build an application to spin up and spin down a container using our GQL API. Please deploy on Railway before the interview and we will review the code during your interview. The app needs to have a UI component and not just a backend that uses the API.
   - You will submit your solution before the interview, and sit down with a member of the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.
3. **Review your solution with the Team:** You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team. Looking for: Learn about your problem-solving skills, how you break down a problem, and how you present a solution.
4. **Meet the Team:** You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.
5. **Offer and Details Chat with CEO:** Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.

**Final Note:** The interview goes both ways. Once again, please ask us things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.

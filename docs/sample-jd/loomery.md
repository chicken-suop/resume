we will fully support your growth and career development.

## The role

We‚Äôre entering an exciting phase with some new client projects on the horizon and are looking for a mid or senior level
Full Stack Engineer, to join our engineering team. Rather than specialise in a single technology, our philosophy has
always been to think through the customer experience and business needs first, then figure out the technical solution
from there. As a result, we‚Äôve deployed a range of platforms and approaches (across web and mobile) - and will continue
to.

In this role you will be:

- Initially working for a new Loomery client on their React Native mobile app (across iPhone and Android), providing
- support, maintenance and periodic additions of new features
- Developing software for Loomery clients, working as part of a cross functional delivery team
- Undertaking experiments, research and development into new technology areas (especially AI and spatial computing) to
  advance those fields
- Developing new capabilities for Loomery and show our clients what's possible
- Consulting and advising clients on the best technical solutions.
- Playing a part in shaping our engineering practice as we continue to scale
  ‚Äç
  The salary range for this role is ¬£60,000 to ¬£80,000. This is a wide range as this role could suit either a mid or
  senior level engineer, the salary offered will be reflective of level and experience.

## The technologies we work with

Rather than specialise in a single technology, our philosophy has always been to think through the customer experience
and business needs first, then figure out the technical solution from there. As a result, we‚Äôve deployed a range of
platforms and approaches (across web and mobile) - and will continue to. This means we‚Äôre looking for someone happy to
get stuck in across languages, technologies and up and down the stack (of course, if you have a specialism, that‚Äôs
absolutely fine!).

The big gigs we‚Äôre pitching for and winning are mobile (both native mobile work and cross-platform mobile technologies
like Flutter/React Native) and web (typically React, Typescript and node.js).

We‚Äôre being intentional about moving into newer technology spaces. That starts with a series of investments in the
metaverse and AR/VR, but we need someone who can be an opinionated leader as we look to build technical capability and
experiment with the possibilities.

## About you

We are looking for someone who is:

- A skilled technologist who has demonstrable experience shipping high quality products to market.
- Experienced in developing mobile apps with React Native (essential).
- Ideally experienced in Flutter or Native app development (iOS/ Android).
- Able to programme in a range of languages, primarily across the Javascript tech stack.
- Naturally inquisitive with an interest in emergent technologies and a determination to apply them in novel and
  innovative ways.
- Collaborative in their approach and can work with non-engineers to deliver against customer and client objectives.
- An excellent communicator who is comfortable talking to clients and non-technical people
- Comfortable working as part of a cross-functional team using Agile practices.

## The company we're building

Loomery is a four year old company, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it'll be like to work here at this early
stage. You will be a critical part of shaping it. However, here are a few things that are important to us.

‚Äç### Principles on the ways we work

Here are a few draft principles that have guided us in our work so far:

- Make each other successful - By paying attention to others we set aside ego and work as a team.
- Passionate about quality - We share high standards, and take pride in the detail.
- Cross-functional and curious - We are open-minded, we ask questions, we listen, we cross-over specialisms and we
  learn.
- Own and act - We value those who move things forward, taking responsibility to solve problems for and with others.
- Care for our clients - We build empathy for our clients and deliver an outstanding service, not just great products.
- Value over process - Our goal is to deliver value fast and we adopt just enough process to make that happen.

### Flexibility in where we work

We know we value time together face-to-face, in our experience it‚Äôs invaluable for building lasting teams. We work
hybrid, partly from home and in our Bloomsbury office 2-3 days per week. We‚Äôll buy you everything you need to work from
home successfully, whether that‚Äôs a new router, a lava lamp, or a standing desk.

‚Äç### Flexibility in how we work

Everyone has different needs and demands on their time. We want Loomery to be inclusive for those with caring
responsibilities or health issues. As parents of young children we know how important it is to make time for growing
families too. Sometimes work shouldn‚Äôt come first. We‚Äôre very open to conversations about flexible working hours and
novel working arrangements.

### Leaving the planet better than we found it

Everyone needs to do more to address the climate crisis, and even though our impact is still relatively small, taking
action starts at home. As a first step we offset all the carbon we use. We‚Äôre also working through the process of
certifying as a ‚Äòpending B-corp‚Äô.

‚Äç### Tinkering & learning
In our industry it pays to spend time learning about the latest technology or tool. We also love it when people we work
with develop new skills and bring new ideas to the team. We provide a ¬£250 technology and learning grant for purchases
of your choice, as long as it‚Äôs aligned with company growth and in budget, we‚Äôll fund it.
